# Automatic1111-Fooocus-Styles
Over 180 styles to reproduce the output of Fooocus in Automatic1111 Web-Ui

IMPORTANT: before using back up the file styles.csv in your "stable-diffusion-webui" install folder.

To use Download the styles.csv file and place in your "stable-diffusion-webui" folder.

Start Automatic1111 and enter a simply prompt like "a cat in a suit", click the styles drop down list (right side by default) and select a style. Click Generate.

Note: Some styles have a label NO and others PO, NO stands for Negative Only and PO for Positive Only. So those styles only effect their respective prompts. All the other styles effect Positive and Negative prompts.

Known Issue: If you have never saved a prompt in the webui since it has been installed you may find the prompts do not show up for you. If this happens make a prompt and save it. This should fix the issue and the prompts should now show up.
